What is IaaC? Why should we use Terraform?

Version Control:

Since it is code, we can maintain in Git to version control. We can completely maintain the history of infra and collaboration is easy.

Consistent Infra:

Often we face the problem of different configurations in different environments like DEV, QA, PROD, etc. Using terraform we can create similar infra in multiple environments with more reliability.

Automated Infra CRUD:

Using terraform we can create entire infra in minutes reducing the human errors. Updating infra using terraform is also easy. Using Terraform we can delete infra.

Inventory Management:

If we create infra manually it is very tough to maintain the inventory of resources in diff region. But by seeing terraform you can easily tell the resources you are using in different regions.

Cost Optimisation:

When you need infra you can create in minutes. When you don't you can delete in minutes, so you can save the cost.

Automatic dependency management:

terraform can understand the dependency of resources. It can tell us the dependency clearly.

Modular Infra:
Code reuse. We can develop our own modules our use open source modules to reuse the infra code. instead of spending more time to create infra from the scratch we can reuse modules.

Terraform Commands
First command is to initialize the terraform, at this stage terraform downloads the provider into .terraform folder.
terraform init
Next we need to run plan command, at this stage terraform compares the infra between declared and existing. This is only plan terraform will not create resources.
